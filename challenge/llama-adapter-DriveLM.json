        "answer": "In the current scene, there are several important objects that need to be considered for the future reasoning and driving decision. These objects include a car driving down the street, a traffic light, a stop sign, a street sign, and a building. The car's position and speed, as well as the traffic light's status, are crucial factors in determining the driver's next move. The stop sign and street sign provide information about the street's name and any potential restrictions or directions. The building in the background adds context to the scene, providing a sense of the surroundings and the environment in which the car is driving."

        "gt_answer": "The action is to keep going at the same speed. The reason is to follow the traffic rules, which has a high probability.",
        "answer": "Based on the given coordinates, the ego vehicle could take the action of turning left at the intersection. The probability of this action is high, as the vehicle is already at the intersection and has the right-of-way. Turning left at the intersection is a common action for vehicles to take when they are approaching an intersection and need to make a left turn. The probability of this action is high because the vehicle is already at the intersection and has the right-of-way, which means it is more likely to turn left than to continue straight or turn right."

Maintain a safe distance from other vehicles: Keep a safe distance from other vehicles, especially if visibility is low due to the rain.2. Reduce speed: Slow down to allow for better visibility and to avoid hydroplaning.3. Use headlights: Turn on headlights to increase visibility for both the driver and other road users.4. Be cautious at intersections: Be extra vigilant at intersections, as visibility may be reduced, and other drivers may not be able to see you clearly.5. Be prepared for sudden stops: Anticipate the need to stop suddenly due to wet roads, and be prepared to react quickly.6. Avoid distractions: Avoid using cell phones, eating, or engaging in other activities that may distract the driver from the road conditions.By following these safety measures, the ego vehicle driver can ensure a safer and more comfortable driving experience in the rainy city street."
